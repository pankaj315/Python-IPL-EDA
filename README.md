# Python-IPL-EDA
Performed end-to-end EDA on IPL “matches” and “deliveries” datasets containing 750+ matches and 179k ball-by-ball records.
This project analyzes IPL match and ball-by-ball data to uncover insights into team performance, player contributions, toss impact, and scoring trends across seasons. Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, interactive visualizations were created to highlight key patterns in wins, runs, boundaries, and player dominance.


Conclusion of the project:
1) The analysis of IPL data reveals that winning the toss provides teams with a slight advantage, with approximately 50-55% of toss winners going on to win their matches.
2) The data confirms that teams generally prefer chasing, with field-first decisions being more common and statistically favorable in T20 conditions.
3) Boundary hitting has increased significantly over the seasons, indicating evolving batting strategies and power-hitting trends.
4) The Mumbai Indians emerge as the most successful franchise with the highest win count, while certain venues like Eden Gardens and Wankhede Stadium dominate as preferred match locations.
5) Batting giants like Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, David Warner, and Rohit Sharma featured as top run-scorers, while several key players dominated the Player of the Match awards, indicating strong match-winning influence.
